        "Led architecture and technical decision-making for a multi-tenant Warehouse Management System (WMS), supporting multiple clients within a shared platform while maintaining data isolation and performance. Coordinated and mentored a team of 4 developers through code reviews, implementation guidance, and support for junior engineers. Owned end-to-end delivery across desktop Windows Forms, web, and API platforms, including requirements definition, development, production deployment, release cycles, and rollback strategies. Led the technical integration with Oracle NetSuite using the SuiteTalk REST API, enabling synchronization of customers, orders, and customer estimates used for monthly billing calculations based on WMS inventory data. Designed synchronization workflows, error handling, and data validation strategies to preserve consistency under real-world failure scenarios. Designed and implemented ASP.NET Core REST APIs for transactional inventory workflows, implemented stored procedures for atomic multi-step operations under concurrent usage, migrated legacy SQL-based architecture toward a service-oriented API model, deployed centralized OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authentication, optimized high-volume SQL Server operations through indexing, query refactoring, and execution plan analysis, and developed an Android barcode scanning application for real-time inventory updates.",
